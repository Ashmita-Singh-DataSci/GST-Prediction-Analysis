To maintain the integrity of the checksum and also to manage the storage, we had to upload our project on google drive. 
This is the link 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/14IJKccVaRNFrfzJcPaDt1WUsxUiFMA0Z/view?usp=sharing
Here, you'll find the datasets, presentation, report and most importantly the notebook with the project. 
Kindly extract the contents from the zip file and then proceed to running the notebook, for further instructions, see instructions.md . 
But also for ease of access, we're uploading the neccesary files separately as well.
